Landing page project for a fictional company - Novatech Solutions.

# Goal
The goal of this project is to build a simple landing page for a fictional company. The main purpose is to highlight my understanding and use of Flexbox in CSS for creating website layouts.

# Execution
To complete this project, I have a style guide and a finished-product reference. The two of these will be used together to complete the landing page as outlined. I will use my judgment on how to approach building each section of the website based on how the section is supposed to look. The fine design details (colours, fonts, font size, etc) will be tailored and modified based on the styling guide provided.
